# UPCA: Unified Predictive Cognitive Architecture

ðŸ§  UPCA is a modular cognitive framework for solving abstraction and reasoning tasks, built around dynamic skill learning, hierarchical planning, and symbolic generalization. It demonstrates high performance on the ARC-AGI benchmark â€” achieving over 73% accuracy with efficient execution on commodity hardware.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Skill Memory & Induction**: Stores and retrieves transformation sequences via episodic memory and generalizes them through usage-based promotion.
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Executes abstract plans using recursive resolution of primitives, learned skills, and meta-transformations.
- **Valence-Guided Retrieval**: Combines feature similarity and historical success to rank skills during inference.
- **Modular Agent Design**: Splits reasoning across ME (motor execution), MA (meta-actions), SI (skill induction), and AMC (adaptive control).
- **ARC Benchmark Ready**: Handles visual reasoning tasks from the ARC dataset with high accuracy and fast turnaround.
